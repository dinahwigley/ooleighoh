Not sure how to fix because the error is unknown, obviously with it being unknown this might not be an easy fix but not sure what to do, tried uninstalling the UCP and BLCMM multiple times along with verifying the game files.

After changing to Normal mode after killing the Dragons, and being greedy, I am not able to get the UCP to work. When I select Tools -gt Setup game files for Mods I can set the console key np. When I select Hexedit Executable - gt Fix, I get an error: Error is in Red and when I hover over it says: ERROR\_UNKNOWN. amp#x200B; Now I did have some issues with Kaspersky quarantining the BL2.exe and I had to remove it from quarantine and it worked fine after the first run through.  After being in beta since the last year I have finally released the official version of HexEdit 4.0. The beta version worked fine so I have not been in too much of a hurry to release it. There were a few minor bugs fixes though. HexEdit is written in C++ and this version requires 
Like many people in this community, i was extremely excited to see this post earlier this week: https://amp.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/bidf4o/serious_i_figured_out_another_clue_about_raxxla/ It seemed to be a really good lead and brought a lot of freshness to the hunt for our fabled gateway. To summarize, u/freshkosose discovered that "Raxxla" is the resulting ciphertext of running the word "Kwatis" through a Vigenere cipher with the passphrase of "hexedit". Investigate above HexEd.it, the powerful online hex editor running in your web browser using HTML5/JavaScript technology. Analyse and edit binary files everywhere. i recently started replaying borderlands 2 and so i'm trying out the blreborn modpack, the first time i tried it, the hexediting and BLCMM worked perfectly and i managed to execute it just fine. after that i forgot to run it everytime i opened up my game and realized i was playing the vanilla. so i try to exec through console command but it just types it in the chat. This time when i open the hexedit tool and apply the changes the hexedit tool freezes up and then closes. BLCMM works A hex editor (or binary file editor or byte editor) is a type of computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file.The name 'hex' comes from 'hexadecimal': a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined It seems like the patch no longer works for BL2. I few of my mates have also said that after the update it no longer works for them. Can anyone confirm this and give a potential fix? I have tried re-installing BLCMM but to no avail. I have also tried to Hexedit it again however it comes up with an error, stating "ERROR\_UNKNOWN" Thanks. Free Hex Editor Neo is the fastest large files optimized binary file editor for Windows platform developed by HHD Software Ltd.

BL2 has a 7.9 GB update on steam. I have the hexedit version and whenever i type "exec patch.txt" in the console it just says it in the game chat Any suggestions as to how to fix it? I'm gonna reinstall for now and see if that fixes. Thanks in advance. Title. Basically the UHD patch broke BLCMM and I need a way to enable the optional nerfs and such in the patch. How could I manually Trying to play PSO and wanted to know how to get an xbl account off someone else’s Xbox, is it as simple as copying the data from the systems saves to my memory card? Before anyone says, I’ve had a bad experience soft modding, and the hex editor wouldn’t work for any usb sticks I have available, so both of those are just completely out of the question. 
I've never modded any game before but I really wanted to try the Reborn mod for Bl2. I did all the instructions and everything seems to be in order but when i tried to execute the mod in the console the command is just repeated in the chat w/o the mod being applied. I really don't know what is wrong and would value any help. Thanks in advance https://i.redd.it/at4pnhu0o9q21.png https://i.redd.it/yg5r5pe7o9q21.png https://i.redd.it/piuwtwikn9q21.png. So when I setup or go to "toolgtsetup game files for mods" I can set the console key just fine however when I try to set the hexedit executable key I get the error in title. I have the patch in the binaries folder of BL2. I have BLCMM in the main borderlands 2 folder. Am I missing something? I have checked the FAQ's guide provided and nothing in there addresses this issue, at least that I can see. amp#x200B; Has anyone else come across this? If so what was your fix? amp#x200B; Thank. When selecting the options for the BLCMM-Launcher, my borderlands 2 hexedit executable it just says "unknown". When pressing FIX, an error will show up with the title ERROR\_UNKOWN. Does anyone I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but i'm not sure where else to do so. amp#x200B; Currently i'm trying to install the community patch for BLTPS for the numerous additions and that sweet cut-scene skip but i'm having some issues and I need some help. So I've installed BCLMM and copied over the text file containing the mod into my binaries folder but whenever I get into the game and try to execute the patch it doesn't seem to work. I'm pretty sure I've done everything corre. So I believe I've narrowed down why my Borderlands 2 game is unable to use mods. For some reason my Borderlands2.exe file is unable to be hexeditted. Does anyone know why this is or am I able to just get the hexeditted Borderlands2.exe file from someone. This problem just occurred after I verified the integrity of the game's files after it started to crash on start up (before typing in any commands). I have run the mod before however for some reason when I load BL2 today, the tilde key wasn't bound to the console command, I assumed it was because verifying the game's files reset some of the commands which I typed in before, so In the DefaultInput text document in the Config folder I typed in; ConsoleKey=Tilde Now it comes up with the console. 
I get an "ERROR\_UNKNOWN" when i try to hexedit using the manager. Any advice. If any of you guys rather play with community patch and haven't downloaded the update, play offiline. Thanks to a previous user, it seems now that they removed Hex.Edit from B2 with this update. ~~Any idea as to why they did this? I thought they had no issues with people playing around with it.~~ \ It seems they had to due to base game changes and modifications, thanks to the users below for clarifying. Someone stated that in a discord chat, the devs for UCP are currently working I only want mods that’ll improve what’s already good or just needs an update. So no weapon or gear mods, cause there’s enough loot in this game I don’t need more. I’m looking more for graphics and patch stuff. For instance, I’ve heard about the community patch but I don’t actually know what it does, so if y’all think that’s a good one I’d take your words. Also, I looked on Nexus Mod Manager and it looks like everything is a manual download, is this difficult or can a console plebeian I installed HxD in Windows 10, but ran into some stability issues. Which hex editor So I'm very out of the loop as I haven't played BL:TPS since 2015, and apparently this Community Patch thing looks to address a lot of issues. I'm seeing some instructions for installing it both here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bwfQXWavBDiQuthxueXbRzB7LIx37Ki1a4-P-0qBW8/edit) or here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dEHxsx3rVc), although some instructions mention a "Filter Tool" as being invaluable, yet other instructions don't really seem to mention it? Anyways, before I started. I'm having a issue with TPS i've hexedited it to run the community patch but when i get to start the patch it says it in game. i've made sure i've hexedited it correctly but it's still not working anyone having the same issue.
