Hi, i have an issue with my unlocked Lumia 925(RM-892), my simcard is recognized correctly. On automatic mode i get no service, when i select search for networks the local carriers do show up and when i select the one im on i get service for about 5-15 seconds. During those 5-15 seconds i am not able to call the device from another one, than the signal drops again. I tried factory reset, switching between 2g 3g and 4g, i have verified that it supports all of my carriers broadcast frequencies. Object moved I recently invested in a Microsoft Lumia 950. Yes, it's 2019. I know that. The phone has an update, but whenever it updates, the system displays a sad-face emoji :-( on a black screen. I have reset it back to the previous update, but I am wondering if I can pull the lastest update onto the phone without it failing. Any help and/or advice around the best way to get the Windows 10 phone on the current build? Thanks.

Here's what I did: I went to Insider Settings and set to keep receiving slower builds until the next release as I had done before. Now, I think the key is you need to select Stop Insider Preview Builds under the Fix Me box then on the next screen select to Pause Updates. Then exit out of Windows Insider Settings and use your device normally for a while and periodically go to Settings, Update and Security, Windows Update and upon opening Windows Update eventually it will say Updates are availa.

Hey, A few months (2/3) ago I tried to reinstall the Windows 10 on my Lumia 1520 just to get it clear, fast and working again. But what I found out right after was that my phone was no longer Windows 10, but Windows Phone 8.0. I started freaking out and tried to update, which was not successful at all. I tried once again the Device recovery tool, but only got the 8.0 again. Then Zune cannot recognize my phone and I wasn't successful with any other updating software.

So, I tried reverting back to a normal build from 15007 and part way through doing so on WDRT my PC crashed and restarted leaving my phone mid way through the recovery program. the 950 is stuck on the red screen constantly showing the boot logo. When connecting it to WDRT it is not detected and I have to select a device manually. WDRT will find the software and will start updating the software on the phone, get part way and fail, then I have to go back to the beginning again. Any ideas.

I wanted to downgrade my L640xl. but, I'm on limited data plan. So i went to an Internet Cafe (Google if you don't know what it is), Installed WDRT. WDRT installs Dot Net 4.5 with it and doesn't work without restart. And every PC on that Cafe has this 'Deep Freeze' tool installed which basically reverts every changes i made to that PC. So no WDRT, no DN4.5. I have 3GB/Day plan on my carrier. So, only alternative is USB tethering my Android device to PC and Use WDRT using another cable.

I tried the 10 builds on my 1020 and want to go back, but it won't be recognised by my PC at all for some reason.

I did choose to use the backup. Chose to send the verification code to my other email address, three times, and it never arrived. Eventually turned it off and went to bed. I woke up this morning, turned it on and I'm looking at the standard 8.1 startscreen. Can I still get my backup back? Backup is turned off now, so it should not be overwritten I think.

Hey guys, I have a 1320 that I updated to the Windows 10 beta. That build however was buggy as hell and my phones pretty much useless. I've recently decided to sell of my Note8 and either buy a new phone, or save money and just use my Lumia 1320 but have a few questions. Can I revert it back to 8.1 from the 10? Will apps like whatsapp and reddit and linkedin work? (pretty much the only 3 apps I use on my phone. Thanks to anyone who might be able to help me answer this question.

I am not an insider yet this morning I woke up to a bricked WP. I called B2X and they are saying 2 weeks to get it back at the minimum which is unacceptable considering Microsoft broke my phone. WDRT won't detect my phone a Lumia 950 no matter what I try. I saw someone else post in another thread about how he got it working, but it didn't work for me.

SO my 830 was acting strange and after trying some easy options I decided to take the plunge and do a full refresh of the device with WDRT. Got the WDRT update, plugged the 830, it tells me I already have the latest OS and that it will install a previous version if I go ahead. I thought "no probs, I'll run an update after". Oh yeah? it's been 3 days and I was 'sent back' to WP8.1 and whenever I try to update the OS I get server errors (801881d0). It's not my wifi that's slow, I have full signal.
